### Step 1: Adjust Your Dockerfile

Your Dockerfile is already almost there. The key part you need is the `EXPOSE` command, which indicates to Docker that the container will listen on port 80. You’ve already added that. Here’s your updated Dockerfile with a slight clarification for the `CMD`:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:23-alpine3.20

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json /app

RUN npm i

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

You can now build the image from this Dockerfile. Assuming your Dockerfile is in the current directory, run the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-node-app .
```

This command will build the Docker image with the tag `my-node-app`.

### Step 3: Run the Container

When you run the container, you need to expose the internal container port (port 80) to a port on your local machine so that you can access the application from your browser.

Run the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 --name my-node-app-container my-node-app
```

- `-p 80:80` tells Docker to map port 80 in the container to port 80 on your host machine.
- `my-node-app` is the name of the image.
- `--name my-node-app-container` is the name you want to give your running container.

### Step 4: Access the Application

Now, your app should be running in the container, and the container's port 80 should be mapped to your host's port 80. To access it, simply open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:80
```

or

```
http://127.0.0.1:80
```

### If You Want to Access the Container Manually and Make Changes

1. **Access the container’s shell**:
   If you want to enter the container manually and work inside it, you can use `docker exec` to get a shell inside the running container.

   ```bash
   docker exec -it my-node-app-container /bin/sh
   ```

2. **Start the app manually (if needed)**:
   If the app isn't running, you can also manually start it by running:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

### Solution: Install Vim or Other Editors in Alpine

You can install **`vim`** or use **`vi`** (which is typically pre-installed in Alpine) by installing the necessary package using **`apk`**.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Install Vim** using `apk` package manager:

   First, use `apk` to install Vim inside your Alpine container:

   ```bash
   apk update           # Update the package index
   apk add vim           # Install vim
   ```

   This will install `vim` in your container, allowing you to use it to edit files.

2. **Alternatively, Use vi (Pre-installed)**:
   - Most **Alpine Linux** containers come with **`vi`** pre-installed, which is a basic text editor.
   - If you don't want to install Vim, you can use `vi` directly:
   
   ```bash
   vi server.js
   ```

3. **Exit the container** after making your changes:

   Once you're done, you can exit the container:

   ```bash
   exit
   ```
